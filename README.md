# CobraPinger

CobraPinger is a totally dank command line utility for monitoring youtubers you care about. It looks at an RSS for your favorite youtube channels every minute and when it sees a new video:

1) Downloads the transcript
2) Sends it to OpenAI for summarization
3) Posts in a discord channel with a notification and the summary.

That's most definitely what's up!
